  - Creep Spawner
    - For each spawner
      - If number of patrol units is less than number of orange flags in room, spawn patrol unit
        - **Expand**
      - If harvester unit is less than 6, spawn harvester
        - **Expand**
  - Enqueue Tasks
    - **Expand**
    - For each spawner, if energy is equal to 0,
      - If spawner.memory.IsQueued is undefined, define it to be false. If spawner.memory.IsQueued is false, then: helper function: helper_add_queue(spawner, spawner.name, spawner.room)
    - For each container, extension, lab, link, nuker, powerspawn, storage,tower when energy is 0
      - if structures.memory.IsQueued is undefined, define it to false. If structures.memory.IsQueued is false, then: helper_add_queue(energy_fill, structure.name, structure.room)
      - Define name as [structuretype, name]
    - For each controller, if controller.memory.creep_task is false (should be creep name), helper_add_queue(controller, controller_name, room)
  - For each creep; by role
    - Patrol unit
      - Switch (true)
        - Enemy in room? Mode = attack
        - Creep needs healing? Mode = heal
        - Else: Mode = wait
      - Switch(Mode)
        - attack:
          - If something in in range of melee attack: Melee attack
          - If something is in range of ranged attack: Range attack
          - Else: move towards enemy
        - heal
          - If something is in range of healing: heal
          - Else move towards it
        - wait
          - Go sit at flag
    - Harvester
      - if energy == 0, mode = harvest
      - Switch (mode)
       - harvest
        - harvest till full
       - get_task
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[0] <== Fill the spawner
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[1] <== Upgrade the controller
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[2] <== Fill extensions, towers
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[3] <== Repair structures
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[4] <== Build structures
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[5] <== Destroy structures
        - Check room.memory.task_queue[6] <== Nothing else to do? Upgrade controller
       - do_task
        - switch(task)
          - fill spawner: Transfer Energy to Spawner until spawner is full
          - Upgrade controller: Transfer Energy to controller until creep is dead
          - Fill extensions, tower: Fill structure until full of energy
          - Repair structures: repair structure to max or limit (Ex: Wall max is 3 million, might stagger it up and up)
          - Build structure: Go build the structure until it is built
          - Destroy structure: Destroy the structure until it is destroyed
          - Upgrade the controller until some other task pops up
  - Every 10(?) ticks
    - Build roads from each relevant structure (spawn, controller, source)
      - For Each Room
        - For Each container, controller, extension, extractor, lab, link, nuker, observer, powerbank, powerspawn, portal, rampart, wall, spawn, storage, terminal, tower
          - If structure.memory.roadBuilt equals false or undefined
            - Find path to each spawner, controller, source. For each coord: use Helper_Make_Road
            - set structure.memory.roadBuilt to true
